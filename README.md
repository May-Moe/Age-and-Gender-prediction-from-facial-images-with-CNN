Age and Gender Prediction
This project focuses on predicting age and gender from facial images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We trained a model using the UTKFace dataset and evaluated its performance against our own dataset. Key findings include the model's accuracy, its generalization capabilities, and the observed discrepancies in real-world application due to varying lighting conditions and movements.
Dataset-
This project used the UTKFace and custom datasets for age and gender prediction.

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is employed for the task of age and gender prediction. 
This project uses a fine-tuned VGG16 CNN model for age and gender prediction, employing Haar Cascade for face detection.
Performance evaluated with confusion matrices and scatter plots.

Methods-
The methodology involves preprocessing images, training the model with the UTKFace dataset and custom images, and validating performance through confusion matrices and scatter plots. Data augmentation is applied to handle demographic variability, ensuring robust predictions across diverse facial features.
